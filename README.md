# Target market
The web app targets individuals who have medical policies with insurance companies.

# How it works
The web app assists policy holders to know whether their policies will be subjected to renewal or not. One registers their name, selects the particular plan under that insurer, selects choice of facilities (whether Tier I or Tier II), inputs the premiums paid, claims paid as per the utilization report received, and calculates the loss ratio (premiums paid vs claims paid).
If the loss ratio is above 60%, the client will be subjected to premium loading.
Otherwise, the client will not be subjected to premium loading, and they can proceed and pay the premiums.
